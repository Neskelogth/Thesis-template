\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

\noindent  First of all, I would like to deeply thank my advisor Prof. Mauro Conti, who guided and supervised me in this project. His passion serves as a source of inspiration for me, and involving me in this project helped increase my interest
in the topics we faced during our work together. I am sure his advices will help me in the future as well.\\

\noindent  I also want to address a special thank to Pier Paolo, who helped me in some project I worked on, including the one we discuss in this thesis. His will to help me was inspiring, as well as his knowledge. I will surely make good use 
of the tips he gave me in my career.\\

\noindent I want to express my warmest thanks to my family, especially my parents and my sister, who always supported me and made this possible.\\

\noindent Finally, I would like to express my thanks to my friends, especially Alessandro, Anna, Elena and Lorenzo, for their support and will to help me.\\
